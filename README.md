Whoa. So Rosario, yeah. Just... whoa. The theater was buzzing, right? Could barely hear the opening credits 'cause someone was still crunching popcorn like a determined rodent. But man, the cinematography was something else, like when you find a rare mineral wedged in the dirt -- unexpected and shiny, glinting through all that chaos. 

> I swear the protagonist, with that chiseled face, was as stoic as a boulder ledge. Had this stillness that wouldn’t budge, even when the world was falling like sediment swirling in a river. Felt like my back in that stick-straight chair, slowly turning molten under pressure. Why didn’t I 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   instead, 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it with proper lumbar support? Haha.

There was this scene near the end, where everything imploded like a collapsing volcano, leaving only echoes and dust. Kind of reminded me of that one dig site – remember the one in Chile? Strange how these things connect, like, seriously, tectonic parallels in my brain. My mind strayed. Do boulders even have thoughts? Why do I... No, back to that shot of spinning stars – a real headrush. Like getting dizzy comparing pebbles under a scorching sun.

And the noise! Ugh! Like tectonic plates grinding right in my ears, audiences can be relentless. I mean, they were reactive like a fault line, 𝘤𝘳𝘢𝘤𝘬ing up during bits that were meant to be serene as untouched caves. Was Arthur or... was it you who asked me to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  ? I forget.

Anyway, I could feel the tension building, the plot was as layered as sedimentary rock, full of ancient secrets and undercurrents you'd need to drill into to really grasp. And those emotional fissures? Deep, endless, like crevices waiting for that unexpected quake. I need a map. Or a nap.
